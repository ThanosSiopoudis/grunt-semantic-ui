# grunt-semantic-ui
> A grunt task to help integrate Semantic UI to your project

## Getting Started
If you haven't used grunt before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a gruntfile as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, install this plugin with this command:
```shell
npm install grunt-semantic-ui --save-dev
```
